Time to market is the driving force to make the chip. If the chip has to be manufactured within the small amount of time, then semi-custom design is the best thing to do.

Semi-custom design are the designs that are designed and manufactured by the third-party companies and sold.

The heights of the standard cells are same or multiples of each other. The heiights depends on the number of metals on track. The width of the cells are the multiple of unit tile which is present in the technology file. The characterized library provides library files, timing files and power characterization.

The channel is prsent as shown in the diagram below. The channel is used for the routing the metals tracks. There is also a thing called feed through cells which are used to route through another channels when the layers of the chip is small.

Standard cell design is faster than the full custom design flow and it is more popular.

Macro cells can be placed anywhere in the layout, but it should be placed in such a way that the delay will be reduced.

The identical cells are repeated throughout the chip in the matrix form in Array-Based design style.

In uncommitted gate array, the routing layers are on the top. It is expensive because, we need to get a gate array and do the required things. In committed gate array, the routing layers will be present and we need to do programming to connect them according to our need.

Here, we map the actual design with it and do the routing.

In committed gate array, the example is shown below where there are 5 NAND gates and we route them and use it.
