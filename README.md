Time to market is the driving force to make the chip. If the chip has to be manufactured within the small amount of time, then semi-custom design is the best thing to do.

Semi-custom design are the designs that are designed and manufactured by the third-party companies and sold.

The heights of the standard cells are same or multiples of each other. The heiights depends on the number of metals on track. The width of the cells are the multiple of unit tile which is present in the technology file. The characterized library provides library files, timing files and power characterization.

The channel is prsent as shown in the diagram below. The channel is used for the routing the metals tracks. There is also a thing called feed through cells which are used to route through another channels when the layers of the chip is small.

Standard cell design is faster than the full custom design flow and it is more popular.
